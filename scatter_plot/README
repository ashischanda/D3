We are reading from the csv file and making the graph. 
There are many columns in csv file that have used for different purposes.

It has mouse hover option to show message(tulip) in point.
It has mouse click option for points.

It has mouse hover option to show message in xAxis ticks.
It has mouse click option for xAxis ticks.

We can use different colors on points.
We use different point or circle sizes. 

We grouped the Y-axis text into different colors
==================================================
==================================================
To add zoom in x or y axis, you need to comment on two parts.

zoomBeh = d3.behavior.zoom()
function zoom() {  }
==================================================
// Error: If you zoom the x -axis, then we loss the xAxis rotate view
		  If you zoom the y -axis, then we loss the yAxis text color
==================================================
CSV data information:
X axis: day
Y axis: y_data
        [In js file, we define some range to set Y axis based on the data type values (code)]

color:  color is defined in .js file based on color column value 
		if( d.color ==0) return "green";

		In D3,   there is a default option for color. d3.scale.category10()
		But, since I didn't use standard D3 scatter plot, I guess category10() didn't work.
		Or,  even if it works, it sets the color based on its choice. 
		I can't select specific color.

		var color = d3.scale.category10();	// set color  
		// category10 is a build in function of D3
